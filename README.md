# bash-oop

This project is a kind of proof of concept and _should not_ be used in a proper
project. When __oop.bash__ is included, it gives your script access to several
keywords: `class`, `delete`â€¦ which can be used to declare classes (with untyped
fields), declare instances of those classes, remove instances from the AST etc,
pretty much like any simple object-oriented programming language.

Read __oop_test.bash__ for a concrete example of what kind of syntax is
available. The mangling system is breifly explained in __oop.bash__.
